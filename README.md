## Becoming an author

Feel free to browse the curricula above and reach out if you're interested in authoring one of the yet-to-be-released courses (the ones without links). We are always looking to hire talented authors to help us create high-quality content.

## Philosophy

You can read about our [approach to learning here](https://blog.boot.dev/about/).

## Should I start learning even though a learning path isn't "complete"?

**Yes you should get started - this program will always be improving and never be "complete".** This curriculum will never be "complete" in the same sense that YouTube will never be "complete" - there is new content all the time. We care deeply about the quality of this program and will always be improving and adding to it.
